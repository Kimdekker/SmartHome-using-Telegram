# Manual to making a smarthome system yourself

First things first, what do you need for this manual (sensors you can choose yourself, I'm using a ledstrip for explanation):
- Arduino IDE (or another IDE)
- Board: ESP32 or ESP8266 (I'm using an ESP32, so you might need to adjust the feedback a little if using an ESP8266)
- Ledstrip
- Wiring
- Cable from your PC import to your board
